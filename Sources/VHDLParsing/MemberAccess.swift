/// An expression accessing a member within a record instance.
/// 
/// This type correctly parses the `VHDL` that
/// is used to access a member within a record. For example, consider the record `foo` with the member `bar`.
/// The `VHDL` code to access this member would be `foo.bar`. This type correctly parses this code and stores
/// the record and member as separate properties of this struct. If this `VHDL` is parsed by this type, i.e.
/// by using `MemberAccess(rawValue: "foo.bar")`, then the `record` property will be `foo` and the `member`
/// property will be `bar`.
/// 
/// This type also supports chaining member access as the member property is a
/// ``DirectReference``. For example, consider the record `foo` with the member `bar` which is a record with
/// the member `baz`. The `VHDL` code to access this member would be `foo.bar.baz`. This type will store
/// `foo` in the `record` property and `bar.baz` in the `member` property as a ``DirectReference`` instance.
/// - SeeAlso: ``DirectReference``, ``VariableName``.
