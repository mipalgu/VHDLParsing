/// want to assign a value to. In `VHDL`, you can do this with the statement `x <= (others => '0');`.
/// This type is designed to represent the `others` in that statement and other supported values like it, such
/// as those found in `x <= (7 => '1', others => '0');`. This statement would produce two instances of this
/// type for the values `7` and `others`. This type also supports `VHDL2008` statements that support a range
